# Protein / antibody screening workflow

Figure 15. English infographic. Prepared 13 October 2026.

## Scope and interpretation

The example follows sequence-defined antibody candidates against a protein target, from DNA constructs to physical samples, binding screens, characterization and cell function. It is a simplified logical workflow, not a mandatory six-step protocol. Target preparation and candidate expression can run in parallel; primary screens can use culture supernatant before full purification. Assays are chosen for the molecule, mechanism and program.

Stages 4–5 are highlighted as potential constraints on generating comparable, reproducible multi-property data for AI. This is an analytical hypothesis, not evidence that every program has these bottlenecks or that AI raises realized supplier revenue.

KD, kon and koff can come from the same binding experiment and appropriate kinetic model. Expression data originate during production. Epitope competition binning is not atomic-resolution epitope mapping. Stability, aggregation and polyreactivity require different assays; none is implied to be measured by SEC or LC-MS alone. Cell potency is assay-specific and does not establish clinical efficacy. The label panel is a linked record assembled across stages, not nine independent tests.

Instrumentation is shown separately from recurring inputs. Chromatography columns may be reused. Culture bags and bioreactors are scale-dependent. Shared sample preparation and shared assay readouts should be counted once in a procurement model. LIMS/ELN and orchestration are software systems. Data infrastructure supports the whole workflow, even though integration is shown as the sixth stage.

Supplier lists are selected examples spanning reagents, instruments, consumables or services. A supplier listed beneath a stage is not asserted to supply every item in that stage. This is not a market-share ranking, endorsement or statement about installed systems in one laboratory.
