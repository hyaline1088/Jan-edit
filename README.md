# AI and Life Science Tools — Research Graphics

An English research kit examining how AI-scale candidate generation could shift capacity pressure toward physical construction and experimental validation. ACROBiosystems and NanoMicro are highlighted as two different product pathways, not as investment recommendations.

## Public website

The interactive web edition is prepared at **https://wizardzxx-tech.github.io/chart/v2/**. The site source is in [`v2/`](v2/), with a dark/light theme, a discovery funnel, supplier details, a scenario calculator and a sixteen-figure research atlas. The repository root redirects to the web edition. The original local gallery is retained as [`gallery.html`](gallery.html).

For the repository's initial GitHub Pages activation, choose **Settings → Pages → Deploy from a branch → main → /(root) → Save**. After activation, future main-branch updates publish automatically. `.nojekyll` keeps this as a static site.

## RSI: AI design and biological validation — Figure 16

[Edit the English RSI loop](https://wizardzxx-tech.github.io/chart/v2/editor.html?figure=16) · [Editable PowerPoint](editable/RSI_AI_biology_loop_editable.pptx) · [PDF](RSI_AI_biology_loop.pdf) · [SVG](svg/16_rsi_ai_design_biology_validation.svg) · [Primary sources](rsi-loop/SOURCES.md)

This conceptual recursive self-improvement loop connects AI design to physical construction, biological validation, experimental data and model/policy updates. A gate promotes only verified capability gains. The diagram distinguishes demonstrated closed-loop biological learning from the hypothesis of sustained autonomous RSI and shows the LST infrastructure supporting each experimental cycle.

## Protein / antibody screening workflow — Figure 15

[Edit the English figure on the web](https://wizardzxx-tech.github.io/chart/v2/editor.html?figure=15) · [Editable PowerPoint](editable/Protein_antibody_workflow_editable.pptx) · [PDF](Protein_antibody_workflow.pdf) · [SVG](svg/15_protein_antibody_screening_workflow.svg) · [Sources](workflow/SOURCES.md)

Six stages map DNA construction, expression/purification, binding screens, multi-property characterization, cellular function and data feedback to representative reagents, instruments, consumables and suppliers. Stages 4–5 highlight potential constraints on generating rich, comparable experimental data for AI. All diagram text, frames and arrows are editable; original logos remain images. Supplier examples are not rankings or realized AI revenue claims.

## Main editable graphics

[Download the editable PowerPoint](editable/AI_LST_editable_research_graphics.pptx) · [Read the 12-page PDF](AI_LST_research_graphics.pdf) · [Browse the local HTML gallery](index.html) · [Sources and definitions](SOURCES.md)

The PowerPoint has two slides: a native stage-comparison table, followed by a native funnel and an enlarged LST ecosystem on the right. Table cells, text, funnel shapes, connectors and market labels can be edited individually. Logos and icons are embedded, replaceable images. The SVG exports retain editable text and vector geometry.

## Reading the evidence

The supplied stage counts are illustrative assumptions normalized **per one clinical entrant**. The separate reference funnel used a different denominator, per approved drug; only its visual form is adapted here. The AI-era approval outcome remains unknown. Funnel widths are schematic.

Market anchors keep their original geography, year, currency and scope. They are **not additive**, and each anchor sizes a selected product subset rather than an entire ecosystem box. The media and resin values marked with an asterisk were checked against the official filing index during the preceding research; the original Duoning PDFs are currently unavailable. All investment pools, customer mixes and qualitative matrix positions are explicitly labeled as scenarios or hypotheses.

## Files and editing

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `editable/AI_LST_editable_research_graphics.pptx` | Native editable table, funnel, connectors and ecosystem labels |
| `svg/` | Twelve text-editable vector graphics |
| `png/` | Twelve 4800 × 2700 PNG exports |
| `AI_LST_research_graphics.pdf` | Main graphics first, then the ten supporting figures |
| `data.json` | Supporting-figure values and qualitative placements |
| `ecosystem_data.json` | Editable table values and ecosystem contents |
| `data/stage_comparison.csv` | Stage assumptions and denominator |
| `data/market_anchors.csv` | Values, units, years, boundaries and source URLs |
| `generate_charts.py` | Matplotlib renderer for figures 01–10 |
| `generate_editable_graphics.mjs` | Artifact Tool authoring source for the two editable graphics |
| `assets/sources.json` | Logo/icon provenance and modifications |
| `qa_report.json` | Calculation, geometry, language and structural validation summary |

For direct editing, open the PowerPoint and select a table cell or individual object. Open an SVG in a vector editor to edit its labels and geometry.

To regenerate supporting figures, install `requirements.txt`, then run `python generate_charts.py --out . --data data.json`. Set `LST_CHART_FONT` to a local TrueType font if needed. Fonts are not redistributed.

To rebuild the editable deck in a Codex environment with Artifact Tool, set `PRESENTATIONS_SKILL_DIR`, `RUNTIME_NODE_MODULES`, `RUNTIME_NODE`, and `RUNTIME_PYTHON` to the installed skill and runtime locations. Make `@oai/artifact-tool` available to Node, update `ecosystem_data.json`, and run `node generate_editable_graphics.mjs`. The builder writes a fresh PPTX filename; `LST_PPTX_OUTPUT` can select another unused destination. When changing sourced values, update their citations and scope notes as well.

The exported deck passed package integrity, declared geometry, font-policy and first-party reimport checks. All twelve graphics were visually reviewed. Native editing in PowerPoint or Google Slides was not executed, so cross-application behavior is not claimed to be tested.
